Features I might care about


text stuff that I need to do:
- basic processing - stopword removal, URL/username removal, possibly stemming
- some kinda topic model type of thing
- tf-idf dtm?
- sentiment analysis on tweet text
- 


from tweet dataframe: 
- length of text
- source?
- reply and rt y/n
- reply and rt source/target
- fav, rt, quote counts
- hashtags - treat as same kind of text as text of tweet, or differently in some way?
- IDs/usernames mentioned
- lang (but it's almost always english)
- geo coords are basically always missing - but maybe useful if they appear in other data more often
- some other geo data is occasionally present
- user level stuff from this df:
  - name. do text stuff to it? Or treat as factor? A LOT of levels - probably not useful as factor, unlikely as text but who knows!
  - description - *text stuff* might actually work
  - counts of followers, friends, listed, tweets,
  - account age
  - verified

- THE RATIO or whatever the hell it's called


user-level stuff to pull:
- followed
- followers


What kind of cool network shit could I do?
- second-order follow counts? (i.e. avg # of followers of the accounts someone follows)
- some kind of measure of network density - do the people that a user follows tend to follow each other? 
- Does an account and its friends/followed accounts all follow the same large-follower-count accounts?

Some kind of two-stage type of deal
- If a user has some number of high-confidence tweets of a certain type, tweak other predictions for that user in the direction of the high-confidence ones
  - Maybe do this for all tweets after the first high-conf one?
